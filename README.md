# Milestone13-15-Countries

A list of countries created in a Table View. Select a country and see the information about it. 

This is my favorite project so far. Not only because I made it all by myself, but because I got to work with the most challenging contents I learned on these past months: JSON, DispatchQueues and Auto Layout. 
The first challenge was to find a document in JSON format with coountries and information about them. Once I found it, I had to parse in my code. It wasn't easy. I got stuck for days. And then I saw the way, I mean, I saw a video about debugging. There are many force unwrapps on my code, and it is by purpose. They helped me seeing what was going on and I got to fix it. 

The Auto Layout was another nightmare. At least I worked it out in just one afternoon. The DetailViewController has 7 UILabels and I had to fix each of the constrains to make they look good (or at least not that bad). 

This project is far from finished, but I'm very proud of it.
